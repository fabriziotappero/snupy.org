This is a video documentary of the incredible 6 time motorbike World champion [Adam Raga](http://adamraga.es/).

When I met Adam and saw what he could do with his bike, I told myself *"I must
capture this in a video and show to the World"*. It took me some time and some energy but it
was well worth it.

The availability and professionalism of Adam for the creation of this video was over the top.
