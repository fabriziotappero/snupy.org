This is a video documentary of the incredible 6 time motorbike World champion [Adam Raga](http://adamraga.es/).

When I met Adam and saw what he could do with his bike, I told myself *"I must
capture this in a video and show it the World"*. It took me some time and some energy but it
was well worth it.

Adam was kind enough to dedicate some of his very intensive training time for the
creation of this video. thank you!
