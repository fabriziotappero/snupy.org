This video was made for the opening night of the *restaurant Malpaso* in Carrer Girona 59, Barcelona, Spain.

Beside its primary advertising purpose, this work is a practice that sometimes I put
myself through. The quite long 70mm lens and the very low 1.4/f aperture make the subject
quite hard to be kept on focus. Additionally, city lights usage calls for a not so obvious
color correction and shot matching.
