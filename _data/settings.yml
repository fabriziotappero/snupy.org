blurb: >
  **I loves shooting videos.**
  Specifically I am very much into [complicated digital electronics](http://freerangefactory.org)
    ultimately  aimed at crafting *challanging motion-camera videos* and great aerial videos.
  I specialise as well in Davinci Resolve video editing for post-processing work. 
  If you are interested in knowing more about me, have a look at my video work.
  If you are interested in [my gear](http://snupy.org/gear) or in contacting with 
  me for a movie, an ad, a documentary or something related to videos, 
  do not hesitate to shoot me an e-mail.
